🫧 Flappy Seahorse

Flappy Seahorse is a cozy, kawaii-inspired underwater browser game based on the classic Flappy Bird mechanic.
Players guide a pastel pink seahorse through coral and seaweed obstacles while floating through a bubbly ocean environment with relaxing retro music.

This project was built as a fun, beginner-friendly JavaScript game with a focus on responsiveness, clean structure, and visual charm.
